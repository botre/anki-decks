## Degrees in a right angle

90 degrees.

## Sum of the interior angles of a triangle

180 degrees.

## Sum of a triangle's interior angle and its exterior angle

180 degrees.

## Sum of a convex polygon's interior angles

Given n sides.

The sum of interior and exterior angles is n × 180 degrees.

The sum of exterior angles is always 360 degrees.

The sum of interior angles = (n × 180) - 360 = (n - 2) × 180 degrees.

## Sum of a polygon's exterior angles

360 degrees.

## Vertical angles

Vertical angles are always equal.

## The sum of two interior angles of a triangle equals

The external angle of the opposite angle.

## Isosceles triangle

In an isosceles triangle, two of the side lengths are equal.

The two angles are also equal.

## Equilateral triangle

Triangle whose sides are all of equal length.

All angles are also equal (60 degrees).

## Hypotenuse

The longest side in a right triangle. It is opposite the right angle.

## Vertex

The point where two sides meet.

## Perimeter

The length of a figure's boundary.

## Circumference

Special name for the perimeter of a circle.

C = 2πr

## Pi (π)

≈3.141

## Radius

The radius is the distance from the center of a circle to any point on its circumference.

## Diameter

The diameter is the length of the line through the center that touches two points on the edge of the circle.

## Arc
