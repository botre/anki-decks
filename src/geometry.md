## Invariants

Properties that never change.

## Polygon

A closed shape with three or more sides.

## Trapezoid

A quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides.

## Parallelogram

A quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides.

## Area

Size of the surface of a 2D shape.

## Area of a square

Its side length squared.

## Area of a rectangle

Its length multiplied by its width.

## Area of a triangle

Its base multiplied by its height, divided by 2.

## Area of a trapezoid

Its sum of its parallel sides multiplied by its height, divided by 2.

## Area of a parallelogram

Its base multiplied by its height.

## Area of a circle

πr², where r is the radius.

## Degrees in a circle

360 degrees.

## Degrees in a straight line

180 degrees.

## Degrees in a right angle

90 degrees.

## Sum of the interior angles of a triangle

180 degrees.

## Sum of a triangle's interior angle and its exterior angle

180 degrees.

## Sum of a polygon's exterior angles

360 degrees.

## Vertical angles

When two lines intersect, the angles opposite to each other are called vertical angles.

Vertical angles are always equal.

## The sum of two interior angles of a triangle equals

The external angle of the opposite angle.

## Isosceles triangle

In an isosceles triangle, two of the side lengths are equal.

The two angles are also equal.

## Equilateral triangle

Triangle whose sides are all of equal length.

All angles are also equal (60 degrees).

## Hypotenuse

The longest side in a right triangle. It is opposite the right angle.

## Vertex

The point where two sides meet.

## Perimeter

The length of a figure's boundary.

## Circumference

Special name for the perimeter of a circle.

C = 2πr

## Pi (π)

≈3.141

## Radius

The radius is the distance from the center of a circle to any point on its circumference.

## Diameter

The diameter is the length of the line through the center that touches two points on the edge of the circle.

## Arc

Part of a curve.

## Midpoint

The point that divides a line segment into two equal parts.

## Congruent

Congruent shapes have the same size and shape.

## Prism

A solid figure with two congruent, parallel bases.

## Cylinder

A solid figure with two congruent, parallel circles as its bases.

## Surface area of a prism

2B + Ph.

B is the area of the base.

P is the perimeter of the base.

h is the height.

## Surface area of a pyramid or cone

B + 1/2Ps.

Where B is the area of the base.

P is the perimeter of the base.

s is the slant height.

## Polyhedron

A solid figure with flat faces.

## Pyramid

A polyhedron with a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at a common vertex.

## Cone

A polyhedron with a circular base and triangular faces that meet at a common vertex.

## The Pythagorean Theorem

a² + b² = c²

## Coordinate system

A system for locating points in space.

## Origin

The point where the x and y axes intersect.
