## Difference between UDP and TCP

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol.

A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP.

Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, and efficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only
possible with TCP.

## Multiplexing

Method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium.

## Full-duplex

A full-duplex (FDX) system allows communication in both directions.

Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.

## Half-duplex

A half-duplex (HDX) system allows communication in only one direction at a time.

Examples: Walkie-talkies, etc.

## WebSocket

Communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

## Difference between reverse proxy and forward proxy

A forward proxy enables computers isolated on a private network to connect to the public internet.

A reverse proxy enables computers on the internet to access a private subnet.

## NAT

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network
address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

## Difference between ingress and egress

Ingress refers to traffic that enters the boundary of a network. This may also be referred to as inbound traffic.

Egress refers to any traffic that exits an entity, or a network boundary. This may also be referred to as outbound
traffic.

## Network virtualization

The process of combining hardware and software network resources and network functionality into a single, software-based
administrative entity.

## Difference between absolute and relative URLS

An absolute URL contains all the information necessary to locate a resource.

A relative URL locates a resource using an absolute URL as a starting point.

## DNS: "A" record

Points a domain name to an IPV4 address.

## DNS: "AAAA" record

Points a domain name to an IPV6 address.

## DNS: "CNAME" record

"Canonical Name" record.

Points a domain name to another domain.

## DNS: "NS" record

Specifies the authoritative DNS server for a domain.

## DNS: "MX" record

Shows where emails for a domain should be routed to.

## Service discovery

Service discovery is the automatic detection of devices and offered services over a network.

## SSL

Secure Sockets Layer.

SSL is a cryptographic protocol that provides security for communications over the internet.
