## Difference between UDP and TCP

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol.
A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP.
Overall, UDP is a much faster, simpler, and efficient protocol, however, retransmission of lost data packets is only
possible with TCP.

## Multiplexing

## Full-duplex

A full-duplex (FDX) system allows communication in both directions.

## WebSocket

Communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

## Difference between reverse proxy and forward proxy
