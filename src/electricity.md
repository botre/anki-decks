# Electricity

## Difference between direct and alternating current

In direct current, the voltage is always constant, and the electricity flows in a certain direction. In contrast, in
alternating current, the voltage periodically changes from positive to negative and from negative to positive, and the
direction of the current also periodically changes accordingly.

## Short circuit

A short circuit is an electrical circuit that allows a current to travel along an unintended path with no or very low
electrical impedance. This results in an excessive current flowing through the circuit.
