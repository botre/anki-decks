# Electricity

## Current

Current is the rate of flow of charge. It is measured in amperes (A).

## Voltage

Voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points. It is measured in volts (V).

## Difference between direct and alternating current

In direct current, the voltage is always constant, and the electricity flows in a certain direction.

In contrast, in alternating current, the voltage periodically changes from positive to negative and from negative to
positive, and the
direction of the current also periodically changes accordingly.

## Impedance

Impedance is the opposition to the flow of current. It is measured in ohms (Î©).

## Short circuit

A short circuit is an electrical circuit that allows a current to travel along an unintended path with no or very low
electrical impedance. This results in an excessive current flowing through the circuit.
