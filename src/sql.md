## ACID

- Atomic
- Consistent
- Isolated
- Durable

## Atomicity

An atomic transaction is an indivisible and irreducible series of database operations such that either all occurs, or nothing occurs.

## Consistency

Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof.

## Isolation

Property that defines how or when the changes made by one operation become visible to others.

## Durability

Guarantees that transactions that have committed will survive permanently.

## Difference between left join and right join

The left (outer) join includes all records from the left side and matched rows from the right table.
The right (outer) join includes all records from the right side and matched rows from the left table.
