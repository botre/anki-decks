# Computer science

## Fuzzy search

The technique of finding strings that match a pattern approximately (rather than exactly).

## Bit-packing

Use as few bit as possible to store a piece of data.

Example strategy: add an n-bit header identifying the size of the value followed by a known number of bits representing the value.
