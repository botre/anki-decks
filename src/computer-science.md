# Computer science

## Fuzzy search

The technique of finding strings that match a pattern approximately (rather than exactly).

## Bit-packing

Use as few bit as possible to store a piece of data.

Example strategy: add an n-bit header identifying the size of the value followed by a known number of bits representing
the value.

## Bitwise AND

Takes two bits and returns 1 if both bits are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Bitwise OR

Takes two bits and returns 1 if either of the bits are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Bitwise XOR

Takes two bits and returns 1 if exactly one the bits is 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Bitwise NOT

Inverts bits. A 0 becomes a 1. A 1 becomes a 0.

## Least significant bit (LSB)

Right-most bit.

## Most significant bit (MSB)

Left-most bit.

## Container

Isolated user space instance existing in the kernel.

## Currying

The transformation of a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of single-argument functions.

## Closure

Persistent local variable scope.

## Scope

The part of a program where a name binding is valid.

## Higher-order function

A function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.

## Anonymous function

Function definition that is not bound to an identifier.

## Prototypical inheritance

The ability to access object properties from another object.

## Static typing

Types are assigned at compile time.

## Dynamic typing

Types are assigned at runtime.

## Interpreter

Computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring
them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

## Double-precision

Using two computer words rather than one to represent a number.

## Associative array

Array that can be indexed not only with numbers, but also with strings or other values.

## Tail recursion

Recursive function in which the recursive call is the last statement that is executed by the function.

So basically nothing is left to execute after the recursion call.

## LSP

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) defines the protocol used between an editor or IDE and a language server that
provides language features like auto complete, go to definition, find all references etc.

## CocoaPods

Application level dependency manager for Objective-C, Swift and any other languages that run on the Objective-C runtime.

## ANTLR

"ANother Tool for Language Recognition".

Parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files.

Used to build languages, tools, and frameworks.

From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.

## Gradle

Java-focused build automation tool.
