# Computer science

## Fuzzy search

The technique of finding strings that match a pattern approximately (rather than exactly).

## Bit-packing

Use as few bit as possible to store a piece of data.

Example strategy: add an n-bit header identifying the size of the value followed by a known number of bits representing
the value.

## Bitwise AND

Takes two bits and returns 1 if both bits are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Bitwise OR

Takes two bits and returns 1 if either of the bits are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Bitwise XOR

Takes two bits and returns 1 if exactly one the bits is 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Bitwise NOT

Inverts bits. A 0 becomes a 1. A 1 becomes a 0.

## Least significant bit (LSB)

Right-most bit.

## Most significant bit (MSB)

Left-most bit.

## Orchestration

The automated configuration, coordination, and management of computer systems and software.

## Kernel

The main layer between the OS and underlying computer hardware.

## Container

Isolated user space instance existing in the kernel.

## Currying

The transformation of a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of single-argument functions.

## Closure

Persistent local variable scope.

## Higher-order function

A function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.

## Anonymous function

Function definition that is not bound to an identifier.

## Prototypical inheritance

The ability to access object properties from another object.

## Dynamic typing

The compiler or interpreter assigns a type to all the variables at run-time.

## Interpreter

Computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring
them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.

## Double-precision

Using two computer words rather than one to represent a number.
