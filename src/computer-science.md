# Computer science

## Fuzzy search

The technique of finding strings that match a pattern approximately (rather than exactly).

## Bit-packing

Use as few bit as possible to store a piece of data.

Example strategy: add an n-bit header identifying the size of the value followed by a known number of bits representing the value.

## Bitwise AND

Takes two bits and returns 1 if both bits are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Bitwise OR

Takes two bits and returns 1 if either of the bits are 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Bitwise XOR

Takes two bits and returns 1 if exactly one the bits is 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Bitwise NOT

Inverts bits. A 0 becomes a 1. A 1 becomes a 0.

## Least significant bit (LSB)

Right-most bit.

## Most significant bit (MSB)

Left-most bit.
