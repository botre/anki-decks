## How to diminish an interval

Subtract a half step from a perfect or minor interval.

## Interval needed in order to reach the octave from a given note

Inversion

## Compounded interval

Interval bigger than an octave.

## Unison

The same note being played harmonically.

## Chromatic scale

Half steps in succession.

## Whole tone scale

Whole steps in succession.

## Symmetric scale

Scale made up of the same interval(s).

## Cadence

End of a musical segment.

## Triad

Simultaneous sounding of three notes.

## Major triad

Major third + minor third

## Minor triad

Minor third + major third

## Diminished triad
