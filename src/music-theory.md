## How to augment an interval

Add a half step to a perfect or major interval.

## How to diminish an interval

Subtract a half step from a perfect or minor interval.

## Compounded interval

Interval bigger than an octave.

## Unison

The same note being played harmonically.

## Chromatic scale

Half steps in succession.

## Whole tone scale

Whole steps in succession.

## Symmetric scale

Scale made up of the same interval(s).

## Cadence

End of a musical segment.

## Bass guitar: fret dots

3 - 5 - 7 - 9 - 12 (double) - 15 - 17 - 19 - 21

## Bass guitar: notes on open strings

E A D G

## Bass guitar: notes at dots, first dot (third fret)

G C F A#

## Bass guitar: notes at dots, second dot (fifth fret)

A D G C

## Bass guitar: notes at dots, third dot (seventh fret)

B E A D

## Bass guitar: how many frets to subtract to find same note (+0 octave) on next higher string

5

## Bass guitar: how many frets to add to find same note (+1 octave) on next higher string

7

## Bass guitar: how many frets to subtract to find same note (-1 octave) on next lower string

7

## Bass guitar: how many frets to add to find same note (+0 octave) on next lower string

5

## Bass guitar: fourth location

Same fret, one string up.

## Bass guitar: fifth location

Two frets up, one string up.

## Bass guitar: octave location

Two frets up, two string up.

## Scale steps: Major

Root W W H W W W H

## Scale steps: Minor

Root W H W W H W W

## Triad

Three notes stacked in consecutive thirds.

## Major triad

Major third + minor third

## Minor triad

Minor third + major third

## Diminished triad

Minor third + minor third

## Augmented triad

Major third + major third

## How to invert a triad

Take the lowest note and place it up an octave.

## Diatonic

Using only notes from a specific scale.

## Chromatic

Using all 12 notes.

## Tonic

The first and main note of the scale.

## Scale degrees

Scale degrees are the number values assigned to the steps of the musical scale.

In typical seven note scales like the major scale and minor scale, the scale degrees are numbered from 1 to 7.

The scale degree is the position of a particular note on a scale relative to the tonic.

## Functional harmony

Music that works within a tonal framework and uses chords that have specific functions in that tonality.

Home -> not home -> home

## Modal music

Music that finds tension and release through colors of sound rather than through functional harmony.

## Chord function

The role of a chord in relation to a diatonic key.

- Tonic
- Dominant
- Subdominant

## Dominant

Seventh chord built on the fifth scale degree.

Creates tension that wants to resolve to the tonic.

## Subdominant

Chord build on the fourth scale degree.

## Phrasing

The method by which a musician shapes a sequence of notes in a passage of music to allow expression.

## Articulation

Articulation is a fundamental musical parameter that determines how a single note or other discrete event is sounded.

- Short or long
- Strong or soft attack
- Quiet or loud

## Voice leading

How chords flow from one to another.

## Closed voicing

Voicing in which all the notes in the chord are arranged as close together as possible.

## Open voicing

Voicing in which all the notes in the chord are arranged as far apart as possible.

## Suspended chord

Triad without a third. Using a second of fourth instead.

## sus2

The second takes the place of the third.

## sus4

The fourth takes the place of the third.

## Chord tone

A chord tone is a note that exists within a certain chord.

## Slash chord

Triad over a bass note that is not a chord tone.

## Polychord

Two chords, most often triads, stacked on top of each other.

## Alteration

Half step up or down applied to:

- 9ths
- 11ths
- 13ths

## Approach tone

Note leading up to a chord tone.

## Cadence

Series of chords that lock you in the key of the tonic.

## Chord

The sounding of more than two notes together.

## Consonant

Two or more tones sounding together in a pleasant way.

## Dissonant

Two or more tones sounding together in a harsh way.

## Density

Refers to how many notes are played in a given time.

## Tonal displacement

Moving a note or group of notes up or down by a certain interval.

## Downbeat

First beat of a bar.

## Dynamics

Musical expression of from soft to loud.

## Enharmonic

Notes that sound the same but are named differently.

## Extension notes

Non-chord notes

## Pickup

A note or group of notes in the beginning of a musical piece or section thereof that comes before the first downbeat.
