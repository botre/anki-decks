- Octave

## How to augment an interval

Add a half step to a perfect or major interval.

## How to diminish an interval

Subtract a half step from a perfect or minor interval.

## Interval needed in order to reach the octave from a given note

Inversion

## Compounded interval

Interval bigger than an octave.

## Quality inversion: minor

Major

## Quality inversion: major

Minor

## Quality inversion: perfect

Perfect

## Quality inversion: diminished

Augmented

## Quality inversion: augmented

Diminished

## Unison

The same note being played harmonically.

## Chromatic scale

Half steps in succession.

## Whole tone scale

Whole steps in succession.

## Symmetric scale

Scale made up of the same interval(s).

## Cadence

End of a musical segment.

## Bass guitar: fret dots

3 - 5 - 7 - 9 - 12 (double) - 15 - 17 - 19 - 21

## Bass guitar: notes on open strings

E A D G

## Bass guitar: notes at dots, first dot (third fret)

G C F A#

## Bass guitar: notes at dots, second dot (fifth fret)

A D G C

## Bass guitar: notes at dots, third dot (seventh fret)

B E A D

## Bass guitar: how many frets to subtract to find same note on next higher string

5

## Bass guitar: how many frets to add to find same note on next higher string

7

## Bass guitar: how many frets to subtract to find same note on next lower string

7

## Bass guitar: how many frets to add to find same note on next lower string

5

## Bass guitar: fourth location

Same fret, one string up.

## Bass guitar: fifth location

Two frets up, one string up.

## Bass guitar: octave location

Two frets up, two string up.

## Scale steps: Major

W W H W W W H

## Triad

Three notes stacked in consecutive thirds.

## Major triad

Major third + minor third

## Minor triad

Minor third + major third

## Diminished triad

Minor third + minor third

## Augmented triad

Major third + major third

## How to invert a triad

Take the lowest note and place it up an octave.

## Diatonic

Using only notes from a specific scale.

## Chromatic

Using all 12 notes.

## Scale degrees

Scale degrees are the number values assigned to the steps of the musical scale.

In typical seven note scales like the major scale and minor scale, the scale degrees are numbered from 1 to 7.

The scale degree is the position of a particular note on a scale relative to the tonic, the first and main note of the scale.

## Functional harmony

Music that works within a tonal framework and uses chords that have specific functions in that tonality.

Home -> not home -> home

## Modal music

Music that finds tension and release through colors of sound rather than through functional harmony.

## Chord function

The role of a chord in relation to a diatonic key.

- Tonic
- Dominant
- Subdominant

## Phrasing

The method by which a musician shapes a sequence of notes in a passage of music to allow expression.

## Articulation

Articulation is a fundamental musical parameter that determines how a single note or other discrete event is sounded.

## Voice leading

How chords flow from one to another.

## Closed voicing

Voicing in which all the notes in the chord are arranged as close together as possible.

## Open voicing

Voicing in which all the notes in the chord are arranged as far apart as possible.

## Suspended chord

Triad without a third. Using a second of fourth instead.

## sus2

The second takes the place of the third.

## sus4

The fourth takes the place of the third.

## Chord tone

A chord tone is a note that exists within a certain chord.

## Slash chord

Triad over a bass note that is not a chord tone.

## Polychord

Two chords, most often triads, stacked on top of each other.
